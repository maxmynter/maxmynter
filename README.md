Hey there, 

i'm Max. A data and ML literate software engineer with an academic background in Physics, Sociology, and Technology Management.

On GitHub you find my open source work that i do as part of my job at appliedAI. Noteworthy libraries are 

- lakeFS-spec, a Python filesystem for the lakeFS data lake,
- nnbench, a PyTest like framework for benchmarking ML models, and
- jobq, a cluster workflow management and scheduling tool.

I am also currently (as of Jan '25) working on repolishing my M.Sc. thesis (Information Theory and Chaotic Systems). 

This repo, as well as my OSS work are pinned below.

Other than that, you will find some side projects, a lot of my (unpolished) work when I teach myself new technologies and computer science fundamentals and the occasional bug fix in the wild.
