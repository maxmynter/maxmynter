Hey there, 

I'm [Max](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxmynter/), a data and ML literate software engineer with an academic background in Physics, Sociology, and Technology Management.

I just started as a Research Engineer at [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/) (yay!!).

I'm productive in Python, Rust, and JS/TS and dabble in Haskell and C++. 

I love open source, care about all things dev tools. Most notably I built lakeFS-spec, a Python filesystem for the lakeFS data lake, during my time at applied AI and made contributions to [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pulls?q=author%3Amaxmynter) and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pulls?q=author%3Amaxmynter).

The Transfer Entropy Toolbox is a scientific computing and information theory project that I'm (as of May '25) preparing for publication with researchers at the German Aerospace Center.

This repo, as well as my OSS work are pinned below.
