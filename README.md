Hey there, 

I'm [Max](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxmynter/), a data and ML literate software engineer with an academic background in Physics, Sociology, and Technology Management.

I'm productive in Python, Rust, and JS/TS and dabble in Haskell and C++. 

I love open source, care about all things dev tools, and built a few during my time at appliedAI: 

- lakeFS-spec, a Python filesystem for the lakeFS data lake,
- nnbench, a PyTest like framework for benchmarking ML models, and
- jobq, a cluster workflow management and scheduling tool.

Recently, I wrapped up a batch at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) where I got into systems, distributed, and lower level computing and taught myself Rust from zero to  production contributions (mostly [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/pulls?q=author%3Amaxmynter), some [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pulls?q=author%3Amaxmynter)).

The Transfer Entropy Toolbox is a scientific computing project that I'm (as of May '25) preparing for publication with researchers at the German Aerospace Center.

This repo, as well as my OSS work are pinned below.
