Hey there, 

i'm Max. A data and ML literate software engineer.
My background is mainly in phyisics, but for reasons I also have a degree in social sciences and technology management.

On GitHub you find my open source work that i do as part of my job at appliedAI. Noteworthy libraries are 

- lakeFS-spec, a Python filesystem for the lakeFS data lake and
- nnbench, a PyTest like framework for benchmarking ML models.

Both repositories are pinned below.

Other than that, you will find some side projects, a lot of my (unpolished) work when I teach myself new technologies and computer science fundamentals and the occasional contribution to an open source tool fixing a bug in the wild.
